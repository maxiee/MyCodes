<h3><a name="BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTS">BC: Equals method should not assume anything about the type of its argument (BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTS)</a></h3>


<p>
The <code>equals(Object o)</code> method shouldn't make any assumptions
about the type of <code>o</code>. It should simply return
false if <code>o</code> is not the same type as <code>this</code>.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="BIT_SIGNED_CHECK">BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares an expression such as</p>
<pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>.
<p>Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can
lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of
SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate
for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice
to use '!= 0' instead of '&gt; 0'.

<h3><a name="CN_IDIOM">CN: Class implements Cloneable but does not define or use clone method (CN_IDIOM)</a></h3>


<p>
   Class implements Cloneable but does not define or
   use the clone method.</p>

    
<h3><a name="CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL">CN: clone method does not call super.clone() (CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL)</a></h3>


<p> This non-final class defines a clone() method that does not call super.clone().
If this class ("<i>A</i>") is extended by a subclass ("<i>B</i>"),
and the subclass <i>B</i> calls super.clone(), then it is likely that
<i>B</i>'s clone() method will return an object of type <i>A</i>,
which violates the standard contract for clone().</p>

<p> If all clone() methods call super.clone(), then they are guaranteed
to use Object.clone(), which always returns an object of the correct type.</p>

    
<h3><a name="CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLE">CN: Class defines clone() but doesn't implement Cloneable (CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLE)</a></h3>


<p> This class defines a clone() method but the class doesn't implement Cloneable.
There are some situations in which this is OK (e.g., you want to control how subclasses
can clone themselves), but just make sure that this is what you intended.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUE">CNT: Rough value of known constant found (CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUE)</a></h3>

      
    <p>It's recommended to use the predefined library constant for code clarity and better precision.</p>

    
<h3><a name="CO_ABSTRACT_SELF">Co: Abstract class defines covariant compareTo() method (CO_ABSTRACT_SELF)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a covariant version of <code>compareTo()</code>.&nbsp;
  To correctly override the <code>compareTo()</code> method in the
  <code>Comparable</code> interface, the parameter of <code>compareTo()</code>
  must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>

    
<h3><a name="CO_COMPARETO_INCORRECT_FLOATING">Co: compareTo()/compare() incorrectly handles float or double value (CO_COMPARETO_INCORRECT_FLOATING)</a></h3>


  <p>This method compares double or float values using pattern like this: val1 &gt; val2 ? 1 : val1 &lt; val2 ? -1 : 0.
This pattern works incorrectly for -0.0 and NaN values which may result in incorrect sorting result or broken collection 
(if compared values are used as keys). Consider using Double.compare or Float.compare static methods which handle all 
the special cases correctly.</p>

    
<h3><a name="CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE">Co: compareTo()/compare() returns Integer.MIN_VALUE (CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE)</a></h3>


  <p> In some situation, this compareTo or compare method returns
the  constant Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is an exceptionally bad practice.
  The only thing that matters about the return value of compareTo is the sign of the result.
    But people will sometimes negate the return value of compareTo, expecting that this will negate
    the sign of the result. And it will, except in the case where the value returned is Integer.MIN_VALUE.
    So just return -1 rather than Integer.MIN_VALUE.

    
<h3><a name="CO_SELF_NO_OBJECT">Co: Covariant compareTo() method defined (CO_SELF_NO_OBJECT)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a covariant version of <code>compareTo()</code>.&nbsp;
  To correctly override the <code>compareTo()</code> method in the
  <code>Comparable</code> interface, the parameter of <code>compareTo()</code>
  must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DE_MIGHT_DROP">DE: Method might drop exception (DE_MIGHT_DROP)</a></h3>


  <p> This method might drop an exception.&nbsp; In general, exceptions
  should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown
  out of the method.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DE_MIGHT_IGNORE">DE: Method might ignore exception (DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)</a></h3>


  <p> This method might ignore an exception.&nbsp; In general, exceptions
  should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown
  out of the method.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS">DMI: Adding elements of an entry set may fail due to reuse of Entry objects (DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS)</a></h3>

     
     <p> The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the
     underlying Map in which a single Entry object is reused and returned
     during the iteration.  As of Java 1.6, both IdentityHashMap
     and EnumMap did so. When iterating through such a Map,
     the Entry value is only valid until you advance to the next iteration.
     If, for example, you try to pass such an entrySet to an addAll method,
     things will go badly wrong.
    </p>
     
    
<h3><a name="DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCE">DMI: Random object created and used only once (DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCE)</a></h3>


<p> This code creates a java.util.Random object, uses it to generate one random number, and then discards
the Random object. This produces mediocre quality random numbers and is inefficient.
If possible, rewrite the code so that the Random object is created once and saved, and each time a new random number
is required invoke a method on the existing Random object to obtain it.
</p>

<p>If it is important that the generated Random numbers not be guessable, you <em>must</em> not create a new Random for each random
number; the values are too easily guessable. You should strongly consider using a java.security.SecureRandom instead
(and avoid allocating a new SecureRandom for each random number needed).
</p>

    
<h3><a name="DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTION">DMI: Don't use removeAll to clear a collection (DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTION)</a></h3>

     
     <p> If you want to remove all elements from a collection <code>c</code>, use <code>c.clear</code>,
not <code>c.removeAll(c)</code>. Calling  <code>c.removeAll(c)</code> to clear a collection
is less clear, susceptible to errors from typos, less efficient and
for some collections, might throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>.
    </p>
     
    
<h3><a name="DM_EXIT">Dm: Method invokes System.exit(...) (DM_EXIT)</a></h3>


  <p> Invoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This
   should only been done when it is appropriate. Such calls make it
   hard or impossible for your code to be invoked by other code.
   Consider throwing a RuntimeException instead.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXIT">Dm: Method invokes dangerous method runFinalizersOnExit (DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXIT)</a></h3>


  <p> <em>Never call System.runFinalizersOnExit
or Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit for any reason: they are among the most
dangerous methods in the Java libraries.</em> -- Joshua Bloch</p>

    
<h3><a name="ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ">ES: Comparison of String parameter using == or != (ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ)</a></h3>


  <p>This code compares a <code>java.lang.String</code> parameter for reference
equality using the == or != operators. Requiring callers to
pass only String constants or interned strings to a method is unnecessarily
fragile, and rarely leads to measurable performance gains. Consider
using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.</p>

    
<h3><a name="ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQ">ES: Comparison of String objects using == or != (ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQ)</a></h3>


  <p>This code compares <code>java.lang.String</code> objects for reference
equality using the == or != operators.
Unless both strings are either constants in a source file, or have been
interned using the <code>String.intern()</code> method, the same string
value may be represented by two different String objects. Consider
using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_ABSTRACT_SELF">Eq: Abstract class defines covariant equals() method (EQ_ABSTRACT_SELF)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a covariant version of <code>equals()</code>.&nbsp;
  To correctly override the <code>equals()</code> method in
  <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the parameter of <code>equals()</code>
  must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS">Eq: Equals checks for incompatible operand (EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS)</a></h3>


  <p> This equals method is checking to see if the argument is some incompatible type
(i.e., a class that is neither a supertype nor subtype of the class that defines
the equals method). For example, the Foo class might have an equals method
that looks like:
</p>
<pre>
public boolean equals(Object o) {
  if (o instanceof Foo)
    return name.equals(((Foo)o).name);
  else if (o instanceof String)
    return name.equals(o);
  else return false;
</pre>

<p>This is considered bad practice, as it makes it very hard to implement an equals method that
is symmetric and transitive. Without those properties, very unexpected behavoirs are possible.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS">Eq: Class defines compareTo(...) and uses Object.equals() (EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a <code>compareTo(...)</code> method but inherits its
  <code>equals()</code> method from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
    Generally, the value of compareTo should return zero if and only if
    equals returns true. If this is violated, weird and unpredictable
    failures will occur in classes such as PriorityQueue.
    In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method,
    while in Java 6 it uses the equals method.</p>

<p>From the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface:
<blockquote>
It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that <code>(x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</code>.
Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition
should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language
is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals."
</blockquote></p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANT">Eq: equals method fails for subtypes (EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANT)</a></h3>


  <p> This class has an equals method that will be broken if it is inherited by subclasses.
It compares a class literal with the class of the argument (e.g., in class <code>Foo</code>
it might check if <code>Foo.class == o.getClass()</code>).
It is better to check if <code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code>.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT">Eq: Covariant equals() method defined (EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a covariant version of <code>equals()</code>.&nbsp;
  To correctly override the <code>equals()</code> method in
  <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the parameter of <code>equals()</code>
  must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_EMPTY">FI: Empty finalizer should be deleted (FI_EMPTY)</a></h3>


  <p> Empty <code>finalize()</code> methods are useless, so they should
  be deleted.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION">FI: Explicit invocation of finalizer (FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION)</a></h3>


  <p> This method contains an explicit invocation of the <code>finalize()</code>
  method on an object.&nbsp; Because finalizer methods are supposed to be
  executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea.</p>
<p>If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the
finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads.
Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize
on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDS">FI: Finalizer nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDS)</a></h3>


  <p> This finalizer nulls out fields.  This is usually an error, as it does not aid garbage collection,
  and the object is going to be garbage collected anyway.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS">FI: Finalizer only nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS)</a></h3>


  <p> This finalizer does nothing except null out fields. This is completely pointless, and requires that
the object be garbage collected, finalized, and then garbage collected again. You should just remove the finalize
method.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL">FI: Finalizer does not call superclass finalizer (FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL)</a></h3>


  <p> This <code>finalize()</code> method does not make a call to its
  superclass's <code>finalize()</code> method.&nbsp; So, any finalizer
  actions defined for the superclass will not be performed.&nbsp;
  Add a call to <code>super.finalize()</code>.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_NULLIFY_SUPER">FI: Finalizer nullifies superclass finalizer (FI_NULLIFY_SUPER)</a></h3>


  <p> This empty <code>finalize()</code> method explicitly negates the
  effect of any finalizer defined by its superclass.&nbsp; Any finalizer
  actions defined for the superclass will not be performed.&nbsp;
  Unless this is intended, delete this method.</p>

    
<h3><a name="FI_USELESS">FI: Finalizer does nothing but call superclass finalizer (FI_USELESS)</a></h3>


  <p> The only thing this <code>finalize()</code> method does is call
  the superclass's <code>finalize()</code> method, making it
  redundant.&nbsp; Delete it.</p>

    
<h3><a name="VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE">FS: Format string should use %n rather than \n (VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE)</a></h3>


<p>
This format string include a newline character (\n). In format strings, it is generally

     <p> This call to a generic collection method passes an argument
    while compile type Object where a specific type from

  (which defines equality by comparing object references).&nbsp; Although
  this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have

<h3><a name="ME_ENUM_FIELD_SETTER">ME: Public enum method unconditionally sets its field (ME_ENUM_FIELD_SETTER)</a></h3>


  <p>This public method declared in public enum unconditionally sets enum field, thus this field can be changed by malicious code

       <p>
    A method that returns either Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE or null is an accident waiting to happen.
    This method can be invoked as though it returned a value of type boolean, and

      <p>
      This implementation of equals(Object) violates the contract defined

  <p> This class/interface has a simple name that is identical to that of an implemented/extended interface, except
that the interface is in a different package (e.g., <code>alpha.Foo</code> extends <code>beta.Foo</code>).
This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements

<h3><a name="NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL">Nm: Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional) (NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL)</a></h3>


  <p> The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.
This is very confusing because if the capitalization were
identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it
seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing.
You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONAL">Nm: Method doesn't override method in superclass due to wrong package for parameter (NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONAL)</a></h3>


  <p> The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match
the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. For example, if you have:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
import alpha.Foo;
public class A {
  public int f(Foo x) { return 17; }
}
----
import beta.Foo;
public class B extends A {
  public int f(Foo x) { return 42; }
  public int f(alpha.Foo x) { return 27; }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class <code>B</code> doesn't
override the
<code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class <code>A</code>, because the argument
types are <code>Foo</code>'s from different packages.
</p>

<p>In this case, the subclass does define a method with a signature identical to the method in the superclass,
so this is presumably understood. However, such methods are exceptionally confusing. You should strongly consider
removing or deprecating the method with the similar but not identical signature.

<h3><a name="ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE">ODR: Method may fail to close database resource (ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE)</a></h3>


<p> The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection

fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close
the object on all paths out of the method.&nbsp; Failure to
close database resources on all paths out of a method may
result in poor performance, and could cause the application to
have problems communicating with the database.

<h3><a name="OS_OPEN_STREAM">OS: Method may fail to close stream (OS_OPEN_STREAM)</a></h3>


<p> The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any
fields, pass it to other methods that might close it,
or return it, and does not appear to close
the stream on all paths out of the method.&nbsp; This may result in
a file descriptor leak.&nbsp; It is generally a good

     <p> The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the
     underlying Map in which an Iterator and Map.Entry. This clever
     idea was used in several Map implementations, but introduces the possibility
     of nasty coding mistakes. If a map <code>m</code> returns
     such an iterator for an entrySet, then
     <code>c.addAll(m.entrySet())</code> will go badly wrong. All of
     the Map implementations in OpenJDK 1.7 have been rewritten to avoid this,

<h3><a name="RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE">RC: Suspicious reference comparison to constant (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares a reference value to a constant using the == or != operator,
where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally
with the equals() method.
It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since
they are different objects.
Examples of classes which should generally
not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.</p>

    
<h3><a name="RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEAN">RC: Suspicious reference comparison of Boolean values (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEAN)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares two Boolean values using the == or != operator.
Normally, there are only two Boolean values (Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE),
but it is possible to create other Boolean objects using the <code>new Boolean(b)</code>
constructor. It is best to avoid such objects, but if they do exist,
then checking Boolean objects for equality using == or != will give results
than are different than you would get using <code>.equals(...)</code>

<h3><a name="RR_NOT_CHECKED">RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.read() (RR_NOT_CHECKED)</a></h3>


  <p> This method ignores the return value of one of the variants of
  <code>java.io.InputStream.read()</code> which can return multiple bytes.&nbsp;
  If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly
  handle the case where fewer bytes were read than the caller requested.&nbsp;
  This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs,
  reads from input streams usually do read the full amount of data requested,
  causing the program to fail only sporadically.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SR_NOT_CHECKED">RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.skip() (SR_NOT_CHECKED)</a></h3>


  <p> This method ignores the return value of
  <code>java.io.InputStream.skip()</code> which can skip multiple bytes.&nbsp;
  If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly
  handle the case where fewer bytes were skipped than the caller requested.&nbsp;
  This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs,
  skips from input streams usually do skip the full amount of data requested,
  causing the program to fail only sporadically. With Buffered streams, however,
  skip() will only skip data in the buffer, and will routinely fail to skip the
  requested number of bytes.</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO">RV: Negating the result of compareTo()/compare() (RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO)</a></h3>


  <p> This code negatives the return value of a compareTo or compare method.
This is a questionable or bad programming practice, since if the return
value is Integer.MIN_VALUE, negating the return value won't
negate the sign of the result. You can achieve the same intended result
by reversing the order of the operands rather than by negating the results.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE">RV: Method ignores exceptional return value (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE)</a></h3>


   <p> This method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked
since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution. For
example, the <code>File.delete()</code> method returns false
if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than
throwing an Exception).
If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation
signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value.

show(), setVisible(), and pack() will create the associated peer for the frame.
With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread.
This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying
listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in
two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that
could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes
components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily
visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.</p>

<p> This Serializable class defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient,
Serializable, or <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and does not appear to implement

<p> This Serializable class is an inner class of a non-serializable class.
Thus, attempts to serialize it will also attempt to associate instance of the outer
class with which it is associated, leading to a runtime error.
</p>
<p>If possible, making the inner class a static inner class should solve the

  <p> This class implements the <code>Comparator</code> interface. You
should consider whether or not it should also implement the <code>Serializable</code>
interface. If a comparator is used to construct an ordered collection
such as a <code>TreeMap</code>, then the <code>TreeMap</code>
will be serializable only if the comparator is also serializable.
As most comparators have little or no state, making them serializable
is generally easy and good defensive programming.

<h3><a name="SE_INNER_CLASS">Se: Serializable inner class (SE_INNER_CLASS)</a></h3>


<p> This Serializable class is an inner class.  Any attempt to serialize
it will also serialize the associated outer instance. The outer instance is serializable,

  <p> This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface
   and its superclass does not. When such an object is deserialized,
   the fields of the superclass need to be initialized by
   invoking the void constructor of the superclass.
   Since the superclass does not have one,

  <p> This class contains a field that is updated at multiple places in the class, thus it seems to be part of the state of the class. However, since the field is marked as transient and not set in readObject or readResolve, it will contain the default value in any

  <p> This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, but does
  not define a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field.&nbsp;
  A change as simple as adding a reference to a .class object
    will add synthetic fields to the class,
   which will unfortunately change the implicit
   serialVersionUID (e.g., adding a reference to <code>String.class</code>
   will generate a static field <code>class$java$lang$String</code>).
   Also, different source code to bytecode compilers may use different
   naming conventions for synthetic variables generated for
   references to class objects or inner classes.
   To ensure interoperability of Serializable across versions,

This cast will always throw a ClassCastException.
FindBugs tracks type information from instanceof checks,

<h3><a name="BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST">BC: Impossible downcast (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST)</a></h3>


<p>
This cast will always throw a ClassCastException.
The analysis believes it knows
the precise type of the value being cast, and the attempt to
downcast it to a subtype will always fail by throwing a ClassCastException.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY">BC: Impossible downcast of toArray() result (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY)</a></h3>


<p>
This code is casting the result of calling <code>toArray()</code> on a collection
to a type more specific than <code>Object[]</code>, as in:</p>
<pre>
String[] getAsArray(Collection&lt;String&gt; c) {
  return (String[]) c.toArray();
  }
</pre>
<p>This will usually fail by throwing a ClassCastException. The <code>toArray()</code>
of almost all collections return an <code>Object[]</code>. They can't really do anything else,
since the Collection object has no reference to the declared generic type of the collection.
<p>The correct way to do get an array of a specific type from a collection is to use
  <code>c.toArray(new String[]);</code>
  or <code>c.toArray(new String[c.size()]);</code> (the latter is slightly more efficient).
<p>There is one common/known exception exception to this. The <code>toArray()</code>
method of lists returned by <code>Arrays.asList(...)</code> will return a covariantly
typed array. For example, <code>Arrays.asArray(new String[] { "a" }).toArray()</code>
will return a <code>String []</code>. FindBugs attempts to detect and suppress
such cases, but may miss some.

<h3><a name="BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOF">BC: instanceof will always return false (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOF)</a></h3>


<p>
This instanceof test will always return false. Although this is safe, make sure it isn't
an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error.

<h3><a name="BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE">BIT: Bitwise add of signed byte value (BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)</a></h3>


<p> Adds a byte value and a value which is known to have the 8 lower bits clear.
Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits
before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value.
Thus, if <code>b[0]</code> contains the value <code>0xff</code>, and
<code>x</code> is initially 0, then the code
<code>((x &lt;&lt; 8) + b[0])</code>  will sign extend <code>0xff</code>
to get <code>0xffffffff</code>, and thus give the value
<code>0xffffffff</code> as the result.
</p>

<p>In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong: </p>
<pre>
int result = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
  result = ((result &lt;&lt; 8) + b[i]);
</pre>

<p>The following idiom will work instead: </p>
<pre>
int result = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
  result = ((result &lt;&lt; 8) + (b[i] &amp; 0xff));

<h3><a name="BIT_AND">BIT: Incompatible bit masks (BIT_AND)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; C) to D,

This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

    
<h3><a name="BIT_AND_ZZ">BIT: Check to see if ((...) & 0) == 0 (BIT_AND_ZZ)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; 0) to 0,

This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

    
<h3><a name="BIT_IOR">BIT: Incompatible bit masks (BIT_IOR)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares an expression of the form (e | C) to D.
which will always compare unequal
due to the specific values of constants C and D.
This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

<p> Typically, this bug occurs because the code wants to perform
a membership test in a bit set, but uses the bitwise OR
operator ("|") instead of bitwise AND ("&amp;").</p>

    
<h3><a name="BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTE">BIT: Bitwise OR of signed byte value (BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)</a></h3>


<p> Loads a byte value (e.g., a value loaded from a byte array or returned by a method
with return type byte)  and performs a bitwise OR with
that value. Byte values are sign extended to 32 bits
before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value.
Thus, if <code>b[0]</code> contains the value <code>0xff</code>, and
<code>x</code> is initially 0, then the code
<code>((x &lt;&lt; 8) | b[0])</code>  will sign extend <code>0xff</code>
to get <code>0xffffffff</code>, and thus give the value
<code>0xffffffff</code> as the result.
</p>

<p>In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong: </p>
<pre>
int result = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)

<h3><a name="BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT">BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT)</a></h3>


<p> This method compares an expression such as</p>
<pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>.
<p>Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can
lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of
SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate
for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice
to use '!= 0' instead of '&gt; 0'.

<h3><a name="BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITY">BSHIFT: Possible bad parsing of shift operation (BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITY)</a></h3>


<p>
The code performs an operation like (x &lt;&lt; 8 + y). Although this might be correct, probably it was meant 
to perform (x &lt;&lt; 8) + y, but shift operation has
a lower precedence, so it's actually parsed as x &lt;&lt; (8 + y).

<h3><a name="ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNT">BSHIFT: 32 bit int shifted by an amount not in the range -31..31 (ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNT)</a></h3>


<p>
The code performs shift of a 32 bit int by a constant amount outside
the range -31..31.
The effect of this is to use the lower 5 bits of the integer
value to decide how much to shift by (e.g., shifting by 40 bits is the same as shifting by 8 bits,
and shifting by 32 bits is the same as shifting by zero bits). This probably isn't what was expected,
and it is at least confusing.

    <p>
This code creates a BigDecimal from a double value that doesn't translate well to a
decimal number.
For example, one might assume that writing new BigDecimal(0.1) in Java creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is actually equal to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
You probably want to use the BigDecimal.valueOf(double d) method, which uses the String representation
of the double to create the BigDecimal (e.g., BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1) gives 0.1).

<h3><a name="DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXT">DMI: hasNext method invokes next (DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXT)</a></h3>

<h3><a name="EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY">EC: equals() used to compare array and nonarray (EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY)</a></h3>


<p>
This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare an array and a reference that doesn't seem
to be an array. If things being compared are of different types, they are guaranteed to be unequal
and the comparison is almost certainly an error. Even if they are both arrays, the equals method
on arrays only determines of the two arrays are the same object.
To compare the
contents of the arrays, use java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[]).

<h3><a name="EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE">EC: Invocation of equals() on an array, which is equivalent to == (EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE)</a></h3>


<p>
This method invokes the .equals(Object o) method on an array. Since arrays do not override the equals
method of Object, calling equals on an array is the same as comparing their addresses. To compare the
contents of the arrays, use <code>java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[])</code>.
To compare the addresses of the arrays, it would be
less confusing to explicitly check pointer equality using <code>==</code>.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE">EC: equals(...) used to compare incompatible arrays (EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE)</a></h3>


<p>
This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare two arrays, but the arrays of
of incompatible types (e.g., String[] and StringBuffer[], or String[] and int[]).
They will never be equal. In addition, when equals(...) is used to compare arrays it
only checks to see if they are the same array, and ignores the contents of the arrays.

<h3><a name="EC_NULL_ARG">EC: Call to equals(null) (EC_NULL_ARG)</a></h3>


<p> This method calls equals(Object), passing a null value as

<h3><a name="EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE">EC: Call to equals() comparing unrelated class and interface (EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE)</a></h3>

      
<p>
This method calls equals(Object) on two references,  one of which is a class
and the other an interface, where neither the class nor any of its
non-abstract subclasses implement the interface.
Therefore, the objects being compared
are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime
(unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class
loading can occur at runtime).
According to the contract of equals(),
objects of different
classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the
contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object),
the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.

<h3><a name="EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACES">EC: Call to equals() comparing different interface types (EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACES)</a></h3>


<p> This method calls equals(Object) on two references of unrelated
interface types, where neither is a subtype of the other,
and there are no known non-abstract classes which implement both interfaces.
Therefore, the objects being compared
are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime
(unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class
loading can occur at runtime).
According to the contract of equals(),
objects of different
classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the

<h3><a name="EC_UNRELATED_TYPES">EC: Call to equals() comparing different types (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES)</a></h3>


<p> This method calls equals(Object) on two references of different
class types and analysis suggests they will be to objects of different classes 
at runtime. Further, examination of the equals methods that would be invoked suggest that either
this call will always return false, or else the equals method is not be symmetric (which is 
a property required by the contract
for equals in class Object).

</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_ALWAYS_FALSE">Eq: equals method always returns false (EQ_ALWAYS_FALSE)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines an equals method that always returns false. This means that an object is not equal to itself, and it is impossible to create useful Maps or Sets of this class. More fundamentally, it means
that equals is not reflexive, one of the requirements of the equals method.</p>
<p>The likely intended semantics are object identity: that an object is equal to itself. This is the behavior inherited from class <code>Object</code>. If you need to override an equals inherited from a different
superclass, you can use use:</p>

<h3><a name="EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMES">Eq: equals method compares class names rather than class objects (EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMES)</a></h3>


  <p> This method checks to see if two objects are the same class by checking to see if the names

different class loaders. Just check to see if the class objects are the same.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUM">Eq: Covariant equals() method defined for enum (EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUM)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines an enumeration, and equality on enumerations are defined
using object identity. Defining a covariant equals method for an enumeration
value is exceptionally bad practice, since it would likely result
in having two different enumeration values that compare as equals using
the covariant enum method, and as not equal when compared normally.
Don't do it.

<h3><a name="EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC">Eq: equals method overrides equals in superclass and may not be symmetric (EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines an equals method that overrides an equals method in a superclass. Both equals methods
methods use <code>instanceof</code> in the determination of whether two objects are equal. This is fraught with peril,
since it is important that the equals method is symmetrical (in other words, <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code>).
If B is a subtype of A, and A's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof A, and B's equals method
checks that the argument is an instanceof B, it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these
methods is not symmetric.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT">Eq: Covariant equals() method defined, Object.equals(Object) inherited (EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a covariant version of the <code>equals()</code>

<h3><a name="FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER">FE: Doomed test for equality to NaN (FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER)</a></h3>

   
    <p>
    This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special
    Not A Number value (e.g., <code>if (x == Double.NaN)</code>). However,
    because of the special semantics of <code>NaN</code>, no value
    is equal to <code>Nan</code>, including <code>NaN</code>. Thus,
    <code>x == Double.NaN</code> always evaluates to false.

    To check to see if a value contained in <code>x</code>
    is the special Not A Number value, use
    <code>Double.isNaN(x)</code> (or <code>Float.isNaN(x)</code> if
    <code>x</code> is floating point precision).

<h3><a name="VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT">FS: Format string placeholder incompatible with passed argument (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT)</a></h3>


<p>
The format string placeholder is incompatible with the corresponding
argument. For example,

<h3><a name="VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION">FS: The type of a supplied argument doesn't match format specifier (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION)</a></h3>


<p>
One of the arguments is uncompatible with the corresponding format string specifier.
As a result, this will generate a runtime exception when executed.
For example, <code>String.format("%d", "1")</code> will generate an exception, since

<h3><a name="VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED">FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)</a></h3>


<p>
A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments.
However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but
does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}).  It is likely
that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string
is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored
and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting.

<h3><a name="VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED">FS: More arguments are passed than are actually used in the format string (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED)</a></h3>


<p>
A format-string method with a variable number of arguments is called,
but more arguments are passed than are actually used by the format string.
This won't cause a runtime exception, but the code may be silently omitting
information that was intended to be included in the formatted string.

<p>
The format string specifies a relative index to request that the argument for the previous format specifier

     Therefore, it is unlikely that the collection contains any objects
    that are equal to the method argument used here.
    Most likely, the wrong value is being passed to the method.</p>
    <p>In general, instances of two unrelated classes are not equal.
    For example, if the <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> classes
    are not related by subtyping, then an instance of <code>Foo</code>
        should not be equal to an instance of <code>Bar</code>.
    Among other issues, doing so will likely result in an equals method
    that is not symmetrical. For example, if you define the <code>Foo</code> class
    so that a <code>Foo</code> can be equal to a <code>String</code>,
    your equals method isn't symmetrical since a <code>String</code> can only be equal
    to a <code>String</code>.
    </p>
    <p>In rare cases, people do define nonsymmetrical equals methods and still manage to make
    their code work. Although none of the APIs document or guarantee it, it is typically
    the case that if you check if a <code>Collection&lt;String&gt;</code> contains
    a <code>Foo</code>, the equals method of argument (e.g., the equals method of the
    <code>Foo</code> class) used to perform the equality checks.

  <p> A method, field or class declares a generic signature where a non-hashable class

A class that declares an equals method but inherits a hashCode() method
from Object is unhashable, since it doesn't fulfill the requirement that
equal objects have equal hashCodes.

<h3><a name="ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT">ICAST: int value converted to long and used as absolute time (ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT)</a></h3>


<p>
This code converts a 32-bit int value to a 64-bit long value, and then
passes that value for a method parameter that requires an absolute time value.
An absolute time value is the number
of milliseconds since the standard base time known as "the epoch", namely January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.
For example, the following method, intended to convert seconds since the epoch into a Date, is badly
broken:</p>
<pre>
Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); }
</pre>
<p>The multiplication is done using 32-bit arithmetic, and then converted to a 64-bit value.
When a 32-bit value is converted to 64-bits and used to express an absolute time
value, only dates in December 1969 and January 1970 can be represented.</p>

<p>Correct implementations for the above method are:</p>

<pre>
// Fails for dates after 2037
Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000L); }

// better, works for all dates
Date getDate(long seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); }

<p> This code generates a random signed integer and then computes
the absolute value of that random integer.  If the number returned by the random number
generator is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since
<code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>). (Same problem arised for long values as well).

<h3><a name="RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE">RV: Code checks for specific values returned by compareTo (RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE)</a></h3>


   <p> This code invoked a compareTo or compare method, and checks to see if the return value is a specific value,
such as 1 or -1. When invoking these methods, you should only check the sign of the result, not for any specific
non-zero value. While many or most compareTo and compare methods only return -1, 0 or 1, some of them
will return other values.

   <p> This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it. For example,
something like </p>

<p>It was probably the intent of the programmer to throw the created exception:</p>

<h3><a name="RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED">RV: Method ignores return value (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED)</a></h3>


   <p> The return value of this method should be checked. One common
cause of this warning is to invoke a method on an immutable object,
thinking that it updates the object. For example, in the following code
fragment,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
String dateString = getHeaderField(name);
dateString.trim();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>the programmer seems to be thinking that the trim() method will update
the String referenced by dateString. But since Strings are immutable, the trim()
function returns a new String value, which is being ignored here. The code
should be corrected to: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
String dateString = getHeaderField(name);
dateString = dateString.trim();

  <p> This class is an inner class, but should probably be a static inner class.
  As it is, there is a serious danger of a deadly embrace between the inner class

<p>OpenJDK introduces a potential incompatibility.
 In particular, the java.util.logging.Logger behavior has
  changed. Instead of using strong references, it now uses weak references
  internally. That's a reasonable change, but unfortunately some code relies on
  the old behavior - when changing logger configuration, it simply drops the
  logger reference. That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim
  that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost. For example,
consider:
</p>

<pre>public static void initLogging() throws Exception {
 Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs");
 logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); // call to change logger configuration
 logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); // another call to change logger configuration
}</pre>

<p>The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't
escape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just
after the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost
(because Logger only keeps weak references).</p>

<pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 initLogging(); // adds a file handler to the logger
 System.gc(); // logger configuration lost
 Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs").info("Some message"); // this isn't logged to the file as expected

<h3><a name="IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC">IS: Inconsistent synchronization (IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC)</a></h3>


  <p> The fields of this class appear to be accessed inconsistently with respect
  to synchronization.&nbsp; This bug report indicates that the bug pattern detector
  judged that
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> The class contains a mix of locked and unlocked accesses,</li>
  <li> The class is <b>not</b> annotated as javax.annotation.concurrent.NotThreadSafe,</li>
  <li> At least one locked access was performed by one of the class's own methods, and</li>
  <li> The number of unsynchronized field accesses (reads and writes) was no more than
       one third of all accesses, with writes being weighed twice as high as reads</li>
  </ul>

  <p> A typical bug matching this bug pattern is forgetting to synchronize
  one of the methods in a class that is intended to be thread-safe.</p>

  <p> You can select the nodes labeled "Unsynchronized access" to show the
  code locations where the detector believed that a field was accessed
  without synchronization.</p>

  <p> Note that there are various sources of inaccuracy in this detector;
  for example, the detector cannot statically detect all situations in which
  a lock is held.&nbsp; Also, even when the detector is accurate in
  distinguishing locked vs. unlocked accesses, the code in question may still
  be correct.</p>

<h3><a name="JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTER">JLM: Synchronization performed on Lock (JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTER)</a></h3>


<p> This method performs synchronization an object that implements
java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock. Such an object is locked/unlocked
using

than using the <code>synchronized (...)</code> construct.
</p>


<h3><a name="JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER">JLM: Synchronization performed on util.concurrent instance (JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER)</a></h3>


<p> This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of
a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances
of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to
the synchronization provided by the Java keyword <code>synchronized</code>. For example,
synchronizing on an <code>AtomicBoolean</code> will not prevent other threads
from modifying the  <code>AtomicBoolean</code>.</p>
<p>Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented,
and may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.

<p> This method calls
<code>wait()</code>,
<code>notify()</code> or
<code>notifyAll()()</code>
on an object that also provides an
<code>await()</code>,
<code>signal()</code>,
<code>signalAll()</code> method (such as util.concurrent Condition objects).
This probably isn't what you want, and even if you do want it, you should consider changing
your design, as other developers will find it exceptionally confusing.

<h3><a name="LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC">LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field.
Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions,
threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object,
<em>if the method can be called by multiple threads</em>.
You can make the field volatile to correct the problem.

<h3><a name="LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC">LI: Incorrect lazy initialization and update of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a static field.
After the field is set, the object stored into that location is further updated or accessed.
The setting of the field is visible to other threads as soon as it is set. If the
futher accesses in the method that set the field serve to initialize the object, then
you have a <em>very serious</em> multithreading bug, unless something else prevents
any other thread from accessing the stored object until it is fully initialized.
</p>
<p>Even if you feel confident that the method is never called by multiple
threads, it might be better to not set the static field until the value
you are setting it to is fully populated/initialized.

    
<h3><a name="ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD">ML: Synchronization on field in futile attempt to guard that field (ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> This method synchronizes on a field in what appears to be an attempt
to guard against simultaneous updates to that field. But guarding a field
gets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not
provide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might
be obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes). An example
of this pattern would be:</p>
<pre>
private Long myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(0);
private Long getNotificationSequenceNumber() {
     Long result = null;
     synchronized(myNtfSeqNbrCounter) {
         result = new Long(myNtfSeqNbrCounter.longValue() + 1);
         myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(result.longValue());
     }
     return result;
 }
</pre>

    
<h3><a name="ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD">ML: Method synchronizes on an updated field (ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> This method synchronizes on an object
   referenced from a mutable field.

threads may be synchronizing on different objects.</p>

    
<h3><a name="MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD">MSF: Mutable servlet field (MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD)</a></h3>


<p>A web server generally only creates one instance of servlet or jsp class (i.e., treats
the class as a Singleton),
and will
have multiple threads invoke methods on that instance to service multiple
simultaneous requests.
Thus, having a mutable instance field generally creates race conditions.

    
<h3><a name="MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFY">MWN: Mismatched notify() (MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFY)</a></h3>


<p> This method calls Object.notify() or Object.notifyAll() without obviously holding a lock

an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.</p>

    
<h3><a name="MWN_MISMATCHED_WAIT">MWN: Mismatched wait() (MWN_MISMATCHED_WAIT)</a></h3>


<p> This method calls Object.wait() without obviously holding a lock

an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.</p>

    
<h3><a name="NN_NAKED_NOTIFY">NN: Naked notify (NN_NAKED_NOTIFY)</a></h3>


  <p> A call to <code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code>
  was made without any (apparent) accompanying
  modification to mutable object state.&nbsp; In general, calling a notify
  method on a monitor is done because some condition another thread is
  waiting for has become true.&nbsp; However, for the condition to be meaningful,
  it must involve a heap object that is visible to both threads.</p>

  <p> This bug does not necessarily indicate an error, since the change to
  mutable object state may have taken place in a method which then called
  the method containing the notification.</p>

    
<h3><a name="NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD">NP: Synchronize and null check on the same field. (NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD)</a></h3>


<p>Since the field is synchronized on, it seems not likely to be null.
If it is null and then synchronized on a NullPointerException will be
thrown and the check would be pointless. Better to synchronize on
another field.</p>


     
<h3><a name="NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL">No: Using notify() rather than notifyAll() (NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL)</a></h3>


  <p> This method calls <code>notify()</code> rather than <code>notifyAll()</code>.&nbsp;
  Java monitors are often used for multiple conditions.&nbsp; Calling <code>notify()</code>
  only wakes up one thread, meaning that the thread woken up might not be the
  one waiting for the condition that the caller just satisfied.</p>

    
<h3><a name="RS_READOBJECT_SYNC">RS: Class's readObject() method is synchronized (RS_READOBJECT_SYNC)</a></h3>


  <p> This serializable class defines a <code>readObject()</code> which is
  synchronized.&nbsp; By definition, an object created by deserialization
  is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for
  <code>readObject()</code> to be synchronized.&nbsp; If the <code>readObject()</code>
  method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread,
  that is an example of very dubious coding style.</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNORED">RV: Return value of putIfAbsent ignored, value passed to putIfAbsent reused (RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNORED)</a></h3>

          
        The <code>putIfAbsent</code> method is typically used to ensure that a
        single value is associated with a given key (the first value for which put
        if absent succeeds).
        If you ignore the return value and retain a reference to the value passed in,
        you run the risk of retaining a value that is not the one that is associated with the key in the map.
        If it matters which one you use and you use the one that isn't stored in the map,
        your program will behave incorrectly.
          
      
<h3><a name="RU_INVOKE_RUN">Ru: Invokes run on a thread (did you mean to start it instead?) (RU_INVOKE_RUN)</a></h3>


  <p> This method explicitly invokes <code>run()</code> on an object.&nbsp;
  In general, classes implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface because
  they are going to have their <code>run()</code> method invoked in a new thread,
  in which case <code>Thread.start()</code> is the right method to call.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SC_START_IN_CTOR">SC: Constructor invokes Thread.start() (SC_START_IN_CTOR)</a></h3>


  <p> The constructor starts a thread. This is likely to be wrong if
   the class is ever extended/subclassed, since the thread will be started
   before the subclass constructor is started.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD">SP: Method spins on field (SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> This method spins in a loop which reads a field.&nbsp; The compiler
  may legally hoist the read out of the loop, turning the code into an
  infinite loop.&nbsp; The class should be changed so it uses proper
  synchronization (including wait and notify calls).</p>

      <p>
      This method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held.  This may result
      in very poor performance and scalability, or a deadlock, since other threads may
      be waiting to acquire the lock.  It is a much better idea to call

  <p> Waiting on a monitor while two locks are held may cause
  deadlock.

but does not release it on all paths out of the method.  In general, the correct idiom
for using a JSR-166 lock is:

<h3><a name="UW_UNCOND_WAIT">UW: Unconditional wait (UW_UNCOND_WAIT)</a></h3>


  <p> This method contains a call to <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code> which
  is not guarded by conditional control flow.&nbsp; The code should
    verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied
    before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored.

<h3><a name="VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY">VO: A volatile reference to an array doesn't treat the array elements as volatile (VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY)</a></h3>


<p>This declares a volatile reference to an array, which might not be what
you want. With a volatile reference to an array, reads and writes of
the reference to the array are treated as volatile, but the array elements
are non-volatile. To get volatile array elements, you will need to use
one of the atomic array classes in java.util.concurrent (provided
in Java 5.0).</p>

    
<h3><a name="WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL">WL: Synchronization on getClass rather than class literal (WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
     This instance method synchronizes on <code>this.getClass()</code>. If this class is subclassed,
     subclasses will synchronize on the class object for the subclass, which isn't likely what was intended.
     For example, consider this code from java.awt.Label:</p>
     <pre>
     private static final String base = "label";
     private static int nameCounter = 0;
     String constructComponentName() {
        synchronized (getClass()) {
            return base + nameCounter++;
        }
     }
     </pre>
     <p>Subclasses of <code>Label</code> won't synchronize on the same subclass, giving rise to a datarace.
     Instead, this code should be synchronizing on <code>Label.class</code></p>
      <pre>
     private static final String base = "label";
     private static int nameCounter = 0;
     String constructComponentName() {

  <p>A primitive is boxed, and then immediately unboxed. This probably is due to a manual
    boxing in a place where an unboxed value is required, thus forcing the compiler
to immediately undo the work of the boxing.

<h3><a name="BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR">Bx: Primitive value is unboxed and coerced for ternary operator (BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR)</a></h3>


  <p>A wrapped primitive value is unboxed and converted to another primitive type as part of the
evaluation of a conditional ternary operator (the <code> b ? e1 : e2</code> operator). The
semantics of Java mandate that if <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> are wrapped
numeric values, the values are unboxed and converted/coerced to their common type (e.g,
if <code>e1</code> is of type <code>Integer</code>
and <code>e2</code> is of type <code>Float</code>, then <code>e1</code> is unboxed,
converted to a floating point value, and boxed. See JLS Section 15.25.

<h3><a name="DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR">Bx: Method invokes inefficient floating-point Number constructor; use static valueOf instead (DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
      Using <code>new Double(double)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas
      <code>Double.valueOf(double)</code> allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM.
      Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5,
      use either autoboxing or the <code>valueOf()</code> method when creating instances of <code>Double</code> and <code>Float</code>.

<h3><a name="DM_NUMBER_CTOR">Bx: Method invokes inefficient Number constructor; use static valueOf instead (DM_NUMBER_CTOR)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
      Using <code>new Integer(int)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas

      <p>
      Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances

<h3><a name="DM_BOOLEAN_CTOR">Dm: Method invokes inefficient Boolean constructor; use Boolean.valueOf(...) instead (DM_BOOLEAN_CTOR)</a></h3>


  <p> Creating new instances of <code>java.lang.Boolean</code> wastes
  memory, since <code>Boolean</code> objects are immutable and there are
  only two useful values of this type.&nbsp; Use the <code>Boolean.valueOf()</code>
  method (or Java 1.5 autoboxing) to create <code>Boolean</code> objects instead.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DM_GC">Dm: Explicit garbage collection; extremely dubious except in benchmarking code (DM_GC)</a></h3>


  <p> Code explicitly invokes garbage collection.
  Except for specific use in benchmarking, this is very dubious.</p>
  <p>In the past, situations where people have explicitly invoked
  the garbage collector in routines such as close or finalize methods
  has led to huge performance black holes. Garbage collection
   can be expensive. Any situation that forces hundreds or thousands
   of garbage collections will bring the machine to a crawl.</p>

    
<h3><a name="DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASS">Dm: Method allocates an object, only to get the class object (DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASS)</a></h3>


  <p>This method allocates an object just to call getClass() on it, in order to

<h3><a name="DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE">Dm: Use the nextInt method of Random rather than nextDouble to generate a random integer (DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE)</a></h3>


  <p>If <code>r</code> is a <code>java.util.Random</code>, you can generate a random number from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>
using <code>r.nextInt(n)</code>, rather than using <code>(int)(r.nextDouble() * n)</code>.

<h3><a name="DM_STRING_CTOR">Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String(String) constructor (DM_STRING_CTOR)</a></h3>


  <p> Using the <code>java.lang.String(String)</code> constructor wastes memory

<h3><a name="DM_STRING_VOID_CTOR">Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String() constructor (DM_STRING_VOID_CTOR)</a></h3>


  <p> Creating a new <code>java.lang.String</code> object using the
  no-argument constructor wastes memory because the object so created will
  be functionally indistinguishable from the empty string constant
  <code>""</code>.&nbsp; Java guarantees that identical string constants
  will be represented by the same <code>String</code> object.&nbsp; Therefore,

<h3><a name="HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANT">HSC: Huge string constants is duplicated across multiple class files (HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANT)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
    A large String constant is duplicated across multiple class files.
    This is likely because a final field is initialized to a String constant, and the Java language
    mandates that all references to a final field from other classes be inlined into
that classfile. See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6447475">JDK bug 6447475</a>

<h3><a name="SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATION">SBSC: Method concatenates strings using + in a loop (SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATION)</a></h3>


<p> The method seems to be building a String using concatenation in a loop.
In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/StringBuilder,
   appended to, and converted back to a String.
   This can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations,
   as the growing string is recopied in each iteration. </p>

<p>Better performance can be obtained by using
a StringBuffer (or StringBuilder in Java 1.5) explicitly.</p>

<p> For example:</p>
<pre>
  // This is bad
  String s = "";
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) {
    s = s + field[i];
  }

  // This is better
  StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) {
    buf.append(field[i]);
  }
  String s = buf.toString();

  <p> This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference

inner object.&nbsp; This reference makes the instances
  of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object
  alive longer than necessary.&nbsp; If possible, the class should be
  made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since the reference to the

   the inner class will need to be refactored so as to
   pass a reference to the outer instance to the constructor
   for the inner class.</p>

<h3><a name="BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION">BC: Questionable cast to abstract collection  (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION)</a></h3>


<p>
This code casts a Collection to an abstract collection
(such as <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, or <code>Map</code>).
Ensure that you are guaranteed that the object is of the type
you are casting to. If all you need is to be able
to iterate through a collection, you don't need to cast it to a Set or List.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION">BC: Questionable cast to concrete collection (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION)</a></h3>


<p>
This code casts an abstract collection (such as a Collection, List, or Set)
to a specific concrete implementation (such as an ArrayList or HashSet).
This might not be correct, and it may make your code fragile, since
it makes it harder to switch to other concrete implementations at a future
point. Unless you have a particular reason to do so, just use the abstract
collection class.

<h3><a name="BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST">BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST)</a></h3>


<p>
This cast is unchecked, and not all instances of the type casted from can be cast to

<h3><a name="BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE">BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast of return value from method (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE)</a></h3>


<p>
This code performs an unchecked cast of the return value of a method.

safe, but FindBugs is unable to verify that the cast is safe.  Check that your program logic ensures that this
cast will not fail.

<h3><a name="BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF">BC: instanceof will always return true (BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF)</a></h3>


<p>
This instanceof test will always return true (unless the value being tested is null).
Although this is safe, make sure it isn't
an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error.
If you really want to test the value for being null, perhaps it would be clearer to do
better to do a null test rather than an instanceof test.

<h3><a name="ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT">BSHIFT: Unsigned right shift cast to short/byte (ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT)</a></h3>


<p>
The code performs an unsigned right shift, whose result is then
cast to a short or byte, which discards the upper bits of the result.
Since the upper bits are discarded, there may be no difference between
a signed and unsigned right shift (depending upon the size of the shift).

      This class is declared to be final, but declares fields to be protected. Since the class
      is final, it can not be derived from, and the use of protected is confusing. The access
      modifier for the field should be changed to private or public to represent the true

<p>
This instruction assigns a value to a local variable,
but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction.
Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never
used.
</p>
<p>
Note that Sun's javac compiler often generates dead stores for

<h3><a name="DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD">DLS: Dead store to local variable that shadows field (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD)</a></h3>


<p>
This instruction assigns a value to a local variable,

<h3><a name="EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS">Eq: Class doesn't override equals in superclass (EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS)</a></h3>


  <p> This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't
define an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will
ignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended,
and that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override
the equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact
that the equals method for the subclass just return the result of
invoking super.equals(o).
  </p>

    
<h3><a name="EQ_UNUSUAL">Eq: Unusual equals method  (EQ_UNUSUAL)</a></h3>


  <p> This class doesn't do any of the patterns we recognize for checking that the type of the argument

<h3><a name="FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY">FE: Test for floating point equality (FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY)</a></h3>

   
    <p>
    This operation compares two floating point values for equality.
    Because floating point calculations may involve rounding,
   calculated float and double values may not be accurate.
    For values that must be precise, such as monetary values,
   consider using a fixed-precision type such as BigDecimal.
    For values that need not be precise, consider comparing for equality
    within some range, for example:
    <code>if ( Math.abs(x - y) &lt; .0000001 )</code>.

<p>
An argument not of type Boolean is being formatted with a %b format specifier. This won't throw an

This feature of format strings is strange, and may not be what you intended.

<h3><a name="IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD">IA: Potentially ambiguous invocation of either an inherited or outer method (IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD)</a></h3>


  <p>
An inner class is invoking a method that could be resolved to either a inherited method or a method defined in an outer class.
For example, you invoke <code>foo(17)</code>, which is defined in both a superclass and in an outer method.
By the Java semantics,
it will be resolved to invoke the inherited method, but this may not be want
you intend.
</p>
<p>If you really intend to invoke the inherited method,
invoke it by invoking the method on super (e.g., invoke super.foo(17)), and
thus it will be clear to other readers of your code and to FindBugs
that you want to invoke the inherited method, not the method in the outer class.
</p>
<p>If you call <code>this.foo(17)</code>, then the inherited method will be invoked. However, since FindBugs only looks at
classfiles, it
can't tell the difference between an invocation of <code>this.foo(17)</code> and <code>foo(17)</code>, it will still
complain about a potential ambiguous invocation.

<h3><a name="IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY">IC: Initialization circularity (IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY)</a></h3>


  <p> A circularity was detected in the static initializers of the two

  behavior may arise from such circularity.</p>

    
<h3><a name="ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE">ICAST: Integral division result cast to double or float (ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE)</a></h3>


<p>
This code casts the result of an integral division (e.g., int or long division)
operation to double or
float.
Doing division on integers truncates the result
to the integer value closest to zero.  The fact that the result
was cast to double suggests that this precision should have been retained.
What was probably meant was to cast one or both of the operands to
double <em>before</em> performing the division.  Here is an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int x = 2;
int y = 5;
// Wrong: yields result 0.0
double value1 =  x / y;

// Right: yields result 0.4
double value2 =  x / (double) y;
</pre>

<h3><a name="ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG">ICAST: Result of integer multiplication cast to long (ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG)</a></h3>


<p>
This code performs integer multiply and then converts the result to a long,
as in:</p>
<pre>
    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000*3600*24*days; }
</pre>
<p>
If the multiplication is done using long arithmetic, you can avoid
the possibility that the result will overflow. For example, you
could fix the above code to:</p>
<pre>
    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000L*3600*24*days; }
</pre>
or
<pre>
    static final long MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 24L*3600*1000;
    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return days * MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY; }
</pre>

    
<h3><a name="IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW">IM: Computation of average could overflow (IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW)</a></h3>


<p>The code computes the average of two integers using either division or signed right shift,
and then uses the result as the index of an array.
If the values being averaged are very large, this can overflow (resulting in the computation
of a negative average).  Assuming that the result is intended to be nonnegative, you
can use an unsigned right shift instead. In other words, rather that using <code>(low+high)/2</code>,
use <code>(low+high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>
</p>
<p>This bug exists in many earlier implementations of binary search and merge sort.

        <p>
        A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes a parameter
    that is marked as @Nullable, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method where that parameter is @Nonnull.
    Doing so violates the contract that the method should handle a null parameter.

<p> The return value from a method is dereferenced without a null check,

<p> There is a branch of statement that, <em>if executed,</em>  guarantees that

would generate a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed.
Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that
the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs.
Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness,
this is a definite possibility.

<h3><a name="NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT">NS: Potentially dangerous use of non-short-circuit logic (NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT)</a></h3>


  <p> This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., &amp;

it seem possible that, depending on the value of the left hand side, you might not
want to evaluate the right hand side (because it would have side effects, could cause an exception

<p>
Non-short-circuit logic causes both sides of the expression

<p> It is often a better design to
return a length zero array rather than a null reference to indicate that there
are no results (i.e., an empty list of results).
This way, no explicit check for null is needed by clients of the method.</p>

<p>On the other hand, using null to indicate
"there is no answer to this question" is probably appropriate.
For example, <code>File.listFiles()</code> returns an empty list

<h3><a name="REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION">REC: Exception is caught when Exception is not thrown (REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)</a></h3>

  
  <p>
  This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not

  say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception
  each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well,
  masking potential bugs.
  </p>
  <p>A better approach is to either explicitly catch the specific exceptions that are thrown,

   <p> The value returned by readLine is discarded after checking to see if the return
value is non-null. In almost all situations, if the result is non-null, you will want
to use that non-null value. Calling readLine again will give you a different line.</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_REM_OF_HASHCODE">RV: Remainder of hashCode could be negative (RV_REM_OF_HASHCODE)</a></h3>


<p> This code computes a hashCode, and then computes
the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the hashCode
can be negative, the result of the remainder operation
can also be negative. </p>
<p> Assuming you want to ensure that the result of your computation is nonnegative,
you may need to change your code.
If you know the divisor is a power of 2,
you can use a bitwise and operator instead (i.e., instead of
using <code>x.hashCode()%n</code>, use <code>x.hashCode()&amp;(n-1)</code>.
This is probably faster than computing the remainder as well.
If you don't know that the divisor is a power of 2, take the absolute
value of the result of the remainder operation (i.e., use
<code>Math.abs(x.hashCode()%n)</code>
</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INT">RV: Remainder of 32-bit signed random integer (RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INT)</a></h3>


<p> This code generates a random signed integer and then computes
the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the random
number can be negative, the result of the remainder operation
can also be negative. Be sure this is intended, and strongly
consider using the Random.nextInt(int) method instead.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED">RV: Method ignores return value, is this OK? (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED)</a></h3>


<p>This code calls a method and ignores the return value. The return value
is the same type as the type the method is invoked on, and from our analysis it looks
like the return value might be important (e.g., like ignoring the
return value of <code>String.toLowerCase()</code>).
</p>
<p>We are guessing that ignoring the return value might be a bad idea just from
a simple analysis of the body of the method. You can use a @CheckReturnValue annotation
to instruct FindBugs as to whether ignoring the return value of this method
is important or acceptable.
</p>
<p>Please investigate this closely to decide whether it is OK to ignore the return value.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT">RV: Return value of method without side effect is ignored (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT)</a></h3>


<p>This code calls a method and ignores the return value. However our analysis shows that
the method (including its implementations in subclasses if any) does not produce any effect 
other than return value. Thus this call can be removed.
</p>
<p>We are trying to reduce the false positives as much as possible, but in some cases this warning might be wrong.
Common false-positive cases include:</p>
<p>- The method is designed to be overridden and produce a side effect in other projects which are out of the scope of the analysis.</p>
<p>- The method is called to trigger the class loading which may have a side effect.</p>
<p>- The method is called just to get some exception.</p>
<p>If you feel that our assumption is incorrect, you can use a @CheckReturnValue annotation
to instruct FindBugs that ignoring the return value of this method is acceptable.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT">SA: Double assignment of field (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains a double assignment of a field; e.g.
</p>
<pre>
  int x,y;
  public void foo() {
    x = x = 17;
  }
</pre>
<p>Assigning to a field twice is useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT">SA: Double assignment of local variable  (SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains a double assignment of a local variable; e.g.
</p>
<pre>
  public void foo() {
    int x,y;
    x = x = 17;
  }
</pre>
<p>Assigning the same value to a variable twice is useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT">SA: Self assignment of local variable (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains a self assignment of a local variable; e.g.</p>
<pre>
  public void foo() {
    int x = 3;
    x = x;
  }
</pre>
<p>
Such assignments are useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH">SF: Switch statement found where one case falls through to the next case (SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)</a></h3>


  <p> This method contains a switch statement where one case branch will fall through to the next case.
  Usually you need to end this case with a break or return.</p>

    
<h3><a name="SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT">SF: Switch statement found where default case is missing (SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT)</a></h3>


  <p> This method contains a switch statement where default case is missing.
  Usually you need to provide a default case.</p>
  <p>Because the analysis only looks at the generated bytecode, this warning can be incorrect triggered if
the default case is at the end of the switch statement and the switch statement doesn't contain break statements for other
cases.

    
<h3><a name="ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD">ST: Write to static field from instance method (ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD)</a></h3>


  <p> This instance method writes to a static field. This is tricky to get
correct if multiple instances are being manipulated,
and generally bad practice.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED">Se: Private readResolve method not inherited by subclasses (SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED)</a></h3>


  <p> This class defines a private readResolve method. Since it is private, it won't be inherited by subclasses.
This might be intentional and OK, but should be reviewed to ensure it is what is intended.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS">Se: Transient field of class that isn't Serializable.  (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS)</a></h3>


  <p> The field is marked as transient, but the class isn't Serializable, so marking it as transient
has absolutely no effect.
This may be leftover marking from a previous version of the code in which the class was transient, or
it may indicate a misunderstanding of how serialization works.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK">TQ: Value required to have type qualifier, but marked as unknown (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
      A value is used in a way that requires it to be always be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but
    there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is required to have that type qualifier.
    Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect.
      </p>
      
    
<h3><a name="TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK">TQ: Value required to not have type qualifier, but marked as unknown (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
      A value is used in a way that requires it to be never be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but
    there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is prohibited from having that type qualifier.
    Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect.
      </p>
      
    
<h3><a name="UC_USELESS_CONDITION">UC: Condition has no effect (UC_USELESS_CONDITION)</a></h3>


<p>This condition always produces the same result as the value of the involved variable was narrowed before. 
Probably something else was meant or condition can be removed.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UC_USELESS_CONDITION_TYPE">UC: Condition has no effect due to the variable type (UC_USELESS_CONDITION_TYPE)</a></h3>


<p>This condition always produces the same result due to the type range of the involved variable. 
Probably something else was meant or condition can be removed.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UC_USELESS_OBJECT">UC: Useless object created (UC_USELESS_OBJECT)</a></h3>


<p>Our analysis shows that this object is useless. 
It's created and modified, but its value never go outside of the method or produce any side-effect.
Either there is a mistake and object was intended to be used or it can be removed.</p>
<p>This analysis rarely produces false-positives. Common false-positive cases include:</p>
<p>- This object used to implicitly throw some obscure exception.</p>
<p>- This object used as a stub to generalize the code.</p>
<p>- This object used to hold strong references to weak/soft-referenced objects.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UC_USELESS_OBJECT_STACK">UC: Useless object created on stack (UC_USELESS_OBJECT_STACK)</a></h3>


<p>This object is created just to perform some modifications which don't have any side-effect.
Probably something else was meant or the object can be removed.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UC_USELESS_VOID_METHOD">UC: Useless non-empty void method (UC_USELESS_VOID_METHOD)</a></h3>


<p>Our analysis shows that this non-empty void method does not actually perform any useful work.
Please check it: probably there's a mistake in its code or its body can be fully removed.
</p>
<p>We are trying to reduce the false positives as much as possible, but in some cases this warning might be wrong.
Common false-positive cases include:</p>
<p>- The method is intended to trigger loading of some class which may have a side effect.</p>
<p>- The method is intended to implicitly throw some obscure exception.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW">UCF: Useless control flow (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains a useless control flow statement, where
control flow continues onto the same place regardless of whether or not
the branch is taken. For example,
this is caused by having an empty statement
block for an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre>
    if (argv.length == 0) {
    // TODO: handle this case
    }
</pre>

    
<h3><a name="UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINE">UCF: Useless control flow to next line (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINE)</a></h3>


<p> This method contains a useless control flow statement in which control
flow follows to the same or following line regardless of whether or not
the branch is taken.
Often, this is caused by inadvertently using an empty statement as the
body of an <code>if</code> statement, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    if (argv.length == 1);
        System.out.println("Hello, " + argv[0]);
</pre>

    
<h3><a name="URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD">UrF: Unread public/protected field (URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> This field is never read.&nbsp;
The field is public or protected, so perhaps
    it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not,
consider removing it from the class.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD">UuF: Unused public or protected field (UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> This field is never used.&nbsp;
The field is public or protected, so perhaps
    it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not,
consider removing it from the class.</p>

    
<h3><a name="UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR">UwF: Field not initialized in constructor but dereferenced without null check (UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR)</a></h3>


  <p> This field is never initialized within any constructor, and is therefore could be null after
the object is constructed. Elsewhere, it is loaded and dereferenced without a null check.
This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since
it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced
before being initialized.
</p>

    
<h3><a name="UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD">UwF: Unwritten public or protected field (UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)</a></h3>


  <p> No writes were seen to this public/protected field.&nbsp; All reads of it will return the default
value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.</p>

    
<h3><a name="XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASS">XFB: Method directly allocates a specific implementation of xml interfaces (XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASS)</a></h3>

      
      <p>
      This method allocates a specific implementation of an xml interface. It is preferable to use
      the supplied factory classes to create these objects so that the implementation can be
      changed at runtime. See
